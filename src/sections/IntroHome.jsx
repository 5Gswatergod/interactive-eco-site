        In our team, to effectively address the issue of microplastic pollution in rivers, we utilized TiOâ‚‚ as a key chemical agent to break down and reduce plastic contaminants. At the same time, we independently developed a customized GIS to track and analyze sources of river pollution. This significantly enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of our project, providing strong technical support for advancing environmental remediation efforts.
